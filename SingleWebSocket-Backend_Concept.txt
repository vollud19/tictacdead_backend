    Frontend -> Websocket -> Backend -> Websocket -> Frontend

# Frontend sends XYZ+Player Message to Websocket 
# Websocket Method calls Backend validate() Method
# If the validation fails, the Websocket returns a error code + Player
# If the validation is a success the valid Position + Player is returned to the subscribed Frontend
# 

# Codes:

    # -200 1/2 Win for Player 1 or 2 (If 2001, Player 1 gets winning screen, Player 2 gets loosing screen)
    # -409 0 Draw (if all fields are filled)
    # -403 1/2 Wrong Placement

    # XYZ 1/2 Position if valid Placement

    # -2031 Player 1 is in use
    # -2032 Player 2 is in use
    # -2021 Player 1 is released
    # -2022 Player 2 is released
